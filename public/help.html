                        <p>Simply press the link and install the extension if you using firefox.
                        If that doesn't work (there seems to be a bug), download the file (possibly with another browser) and go to extensions (addons>extensions).
                        Top left settings button and select  Install add-on from File... Point it to your downloaded file and done.</p>
                        <h1>Install <a href="/lib/extensions/chrome-extension-sample/chrome-extension-sample.zip" class="alert-link">Chrome</a> extension</h1>
                        <p>Chrome is a little more difficult. I can't publish the extension to the store without paying, thus we have to load the extension manually.</p>
                        <p>1. Visit chrome://extensions in your browser (or open up the Chrome menu by clicking the icon to the far right of the Omnibox: The menu's icon is three horizontal bars. and select Extensions under the Tools menu to get to the same place).</p>
                        <p>2. Ensure that the Developer mode checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked. </p>
                        <p>Click Load unpacked extension... and select the unzipped folder
                        that you have downloaded.</p>
